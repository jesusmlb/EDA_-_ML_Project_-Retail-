## Superstore EDA & ML

#### Motivation and audience:

The "Superstore" dataset was chosen because of my interest in retail. It is something that we can see everyday, and it is found everywhere, physically and online. With the tools that we have used here, the business will be able to benefit, it will be able to have a better vision through its numbers, plan and make a better forecast regarding its growth.

#### Problem we seek to solve:

For this dataset, having enough information on sales (4 years), we want to predict the margin (Profit) and know which of our independent variables are the most relevant when it comes to predicting our margin.
